<sup>_(December 2021)_ </sup> <br>
  - Wrangled survey data collected through The Canadian Tobacco and Nicotine Survey with the **`tidyr`** and **`dplyr`** packages.
  - Summarized and visualized the data with tables and plots with the **`ggplot2`** package.
  - Executed the Propensity Score Matching method to determine the factor that affects the probability of trying vaping for the first time.

[**Gender Parity in Black Saber Software**]({{ site.url }}/assets/zeusolutions.pdf){:target="_blank"} _Consulting Report_ ([R]({{ site.url }}/assets/zeusolutions.Rmd){:target="_blank"}, [GitHub](https://github.com/jj-kanu/sta303-zeusolutions)) <br>
<sup>_(April 2021)_ </sup> <br>
  - Collaborated with three peers on a consulting project that evaluated gender parity in hiring, wages and promotion at a simulated software company.
  - Processed and visualized large datasets using the **`dplyr`** and **`ggplot2`** packages to support project analyses.
  - Employed linear and generalized linear mixed models to assess gender parity, including verifying assumptions and interpreting results with confidence intervals and significance testing.
  - Produced a report utilizing **R Markdown** to ensure the report was both cohesive and reproducible.

[**Exploring COVID-19 data for Toronto, Canada**]({{ site.url }}/assets/sta303_data_exploration.pdf){:target="_blank"} _Data Exploration Assignment_ ([R]({{ site.url }}/assets/sta303_data_exploration.Rmd){:target="_blank"}, [GitHub](https://github.com/andyvu016/data_exploration)) <br>
<sup>_(February 2021)_ </sup> <br>
  - Utilized an API to extract current data from the Open Data Toronto Portal.
  - Employed the **`tidyr`** and **`dplyr`** packages to wrangle, parse and transform data on COVID-19 cases across the 140 Toronto neighborhoods.
  - Developed visualizations using the **`ggplot2`** package to effectively communicate insights from the data such as, histograms for the number of daily reported cases, and thematic maps for the proportion of cases by region.
